Disability Pride is the idea that people with disabilities should be proud of their disabled identity. People with disabilities are the largest and most diverse minority within the population, representing all abilities, ages, races, ethnicities, religions and socio-economic backgrounds.

Disability pride focuses on the social model of disability. The disability community views the social model as more positive than the medical model, which is often used to subdue and/or place the individual in a less-empowered role.

## The Disability Pride Flag

There are narrow bands of the same black between the colors.](https://github.com/KristinaEngland/inclusive-by-design/blob/gh-pages/assets/img/Disability_Pride_Flag_Ann_Magill_copyrights_waived.jpeg)

The Disability Pride Flag was designed by Ann Magill.

### What each aspect of the design represents:
- The Black Field: Mourning for those who've suffered and died from Ableist violence, and also rebellion.
- The Zigzag Band: How disabled people must move around and past barriers, and our creativity in doing so.
- The Five Colors: the variety of Disability, our needs and experiences (Mental Illness, Neurodiversity, Invisible and Undiagnosed Disabilities, Physical Disability, and Sensory Disabilities).
- The Parallel Stripes: Solidarity within the Disability Community, despite our differences.

## Is there a designated month to celebrate Disability Pride?

Disability Pride is celebrated all year. In addition, the month of July has become recognized by the disability community as Disability Pride Month as it correlates with the signing of The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The community uses the #DisabilityPride hashtag in Twitter to show their pride for themselves and the overall community. 

### A history of celebrations
- The first Disability Pride Day was held in Boston, MA in 1990. This coincides with the same year the ADA was signed into law, creating a new era of change for the disability community.
- The first Disability Pride Parade was held in Chicago in 2004.
- New York City observed the first official Disability Pride Month in July 2015, the ADA’s twenty-fifth anniversary.
