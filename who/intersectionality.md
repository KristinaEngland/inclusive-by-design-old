"There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle, because we do not live single-issue lives."

Audre Lorde
American writer, feminist, womanist, librarian, and civil rights activist

## What does intersectionality mean?

Every person has multiple identities. We must remember that when talking about any marginalized group. A disabled person is not just a disabled person. They may be a woman, black, and have Parkinson's Disease. They may be non-binary, white, and hard of hearing. Most importantly, they are human beings with hobbies, families, and an interest in learning, exploring, and engaging in the world around them. When we forget to include their access needs in our Diversity and Inclusion discussions, we exclude many of the people we are striving to include.

Keri Gray, founder and CEO of the Keri Gray Group, speaks about Disability and Intersectionality as part of a Ford Foundation video series.

## General Disability Statistics

1 billion people in the world identify as having a disability. 50% of those who identify as having a disability are of working age. Of that 1 billion people, 61 million reside in the United States. In fact, one in four people or 26% of people in the United States identify as disabled. However, not everyone will identify as having a disability. The reasons vary by individual but include:

Some people may fear the stigma that comes with having a disability. They may choose to manage it on their own to avoid discrimination, especially when they are already part of a marginalized group.
Some people may not identify as disabled as they do not think they are "disabled enough," which is a common internal conflict for people who develop disabilities.
Others may not realize they qualify for accommodations or may not want to go through the process required to receive those accommodations.
