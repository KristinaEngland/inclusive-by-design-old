# Understanding Disabilities

## Understanding disability as defined through the social model

The social model defines disability as the decisions that society makes about what makes bodies and minds valuable. Society's ideas then lead to decisions about physical spaces, technologies, laws, and policies. Those spaces, laws, and policies often exclude and discriminate against people whose minds and bodies function differently.  

The social model goes beyond the original medical model of disability by saying if a person is unable to climb a set of stairs, the focus is not on how to fix the person, but rather on how to fix the environment around them. The person isn't the problem - society's definition of how a person should get to the next level of a building is.

Connor Scott-Gardner provides additional examples about the barriers created based on society's views and attitudes.

## Understanding the full range of human differences

In order to build an inclusive environment, we must understand the range of people we are excluding with existing barriers. There are several categories of disabilities and a long list of conditions within each category. A person can have more than one condition and fall under more than one category.

Many of these disabilities were defined as part of the medical model for disabilities, though Neurodiversity has been rewritten by the community to follow the social model of disability. Each page provides examples of conditions that fall under a category, societal and digital barriers, how the community navigates the web, books and videos authored by the community, and more. 

- Blind and Low Vision
- Chronic Illness
- Deaf and Hard of Hearing
- Epilepsy and Vestibular Disorders
- Mental Health
- Neurodiversity
- Physical
- Speech

## Removing societal barriers improves everyone's experience

By excluding what we define as non-typical, we actually exclude our future selves. Disability is part of being human. Almost everyone will temporarily or permanently experience disability at some point in their life.

Not only may we all get a disability, but by viewing the world through an inclusive lens, we actually innovate and make solutions that work for everyone (e.g., curb cuts, audiobooks, etc.).
