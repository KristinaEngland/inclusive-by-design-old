# Understanding the Who Before the How

Before we talk about the various aspects of accessible content and services, it's important to understand why accessibility matters. Without accessibility, disabled people lose out on jobs, are unable to enjoy hobbies others take for granted (such as watching movies or playing video games), etc. So who is the disability community? Let's take a look at the types of disabilities, the history of the disability rights movement, current voices in the community, and more.
